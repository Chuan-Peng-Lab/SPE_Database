### Experiment 1  ：simultaneous shape-label matching task

#### Participants
Thirty participants (9 male, Mage = 22.67, SD = 3.11) were recruited using Prolific (www.prolific.co), with each receiving compensation at the rate of £7.50/h. Informed consent was obtained from participants prior to the commencement of the experiment and the protocol was reviewed and approved by the Ethics Committee at the School of Psychology, University of Plymouth.

#### Procedure
The experimental procedure consisted of two phases. In the initial phase, participants learned associations between geometric shapes and labels representing themselves, friends, and strangers. Following this, participants engaged in a shape-label matching task where they quickly determined if presented shape-label pairs corresponded to the previously learned associations, responding via keyboard keys. Feedback on response accuracy was provided after each trial. Stimuli comprised grey images of geometric shapes displayed on a white background, with participants completing practice trials before progressing to six blocks of experimental trials, where stimuli were presented in either mixed or blocked fashion, ensuring equal distribution of matching and nonmatching trials.

### Experiment 2  ：sequential shape-label matching task

#### Participants
Thirty participants (10 male, Mage = 23.13, SD = 3.22) were recruited via Prolific, receiving compensation at £7.50/h. Informed consent was obtained, and the protocol was approved by the Ethics Committee at the School of Psychology, University of Plymouth. The study employed a 3 (Shape Association: self vs. friend vs. stranger) × 2 (Presentation: mixed vs. blocked) × 2 (Trial Type: matching vs. nonmatching) repeated measures design, with sample size estimation similar to Experiment 1.

#### Procedure
The experimental procedure was akin to Experiment 1, involving a shape-label matching task. However, in Experiment 2, shape-label pairs were presented sequentially. Each trial commenced with a fixation cross (500 ms), followed by a centrally presented shape (100 ms). After a brief interval (200 ms), a label appeared, and participants determined whether the pairing matched or mismatched previously learned associations. Upon task completion, participants received debriefing.
