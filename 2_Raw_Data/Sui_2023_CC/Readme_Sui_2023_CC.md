### Experiment 

#### Participants
Ten pairs of college friends (Mage = 19.85 ± 1.69 years; 8 female) participated in the experiment. All participants had normal or corrected-to-normal vision. Informed consent was obtained prior to the commencement of the experiment and the protocol was reviewed and approved by the local ethics committee. The experiment had a 3 (Shape Association: self vs friend vs stranger) X 2 (Matching Condition: matching or mismatching) repeated measures design. Based on the large effect sizes reported in prior research 
exploring self-prioritization using shape-label matching tasks (Sui et al., 2012), a sample of 20 participants afforded 92 % power to detect an effect of d = 1.0 (PANGEA v0.2). 

#### Procedure
Participants were first briefed on an EEG-recorded shape-label matching task in the lab. The task involved two phases: initially forming shape-label associations (self, best friend, stranger with different geometric shapes) in about a minute without displaying stimuli, followed by a matching task where participants judged shape-label pairings against learned associations. Each trial featured a fixation cross, shape-label pairing, and required a rapid response using specific keys. The task included 960 trials across 16 blocks, with feedback provided after each trial. The experiment, conducted on a PC with a 15" CRT monitor, concluded with participant debriefing and dismissal.
