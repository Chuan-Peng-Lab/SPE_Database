### Experiment 

#### Participants
All participants had normal or corrected to-normal vision and gave informed written consent prior to the experiment. The study was approved by the University Research Ethics Committee and the Psychology Research Ethics Committee of Oxford Brookes University (reference number 1718/122). All participants gave written informed consent approved by the Research Ethics Committee, in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki.

#### Procedure
At the start of the experiment, participants were instructed to memorize two label-shape pairings, which were counterbalanced across participants. Following a training phase without emotional faces, participants underwent a matching phase where they had to quickly judge if a shape-label pair matched. Each shape contained a task-irrelevant face drawing expressing positive, negative, or neutral emotion. The presentation order of shape-label pairs was randomized, with a fixation cross preceding each trial. Participants had 1150 ms to respond, with feedback provided after each response. The experiment consisted of six blocks of 150 trials and a final block of 60 trials, totaling 80 trials per condition.
