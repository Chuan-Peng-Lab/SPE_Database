### Experiment 1：

#### Participants
Thirty participants (Mean age = 24.67 years, SD = 7.05 years, 14 males) voluntarily participated in exchange for course credits. All of them were naive to the purpose of the experiment and reported normal or corrected-to-normal vision. 

#### Procedure
Prior to the experiment, participants at the University of Padova read and signed an informed consent form approved by the Ethics Committee for Psychological Research. The study comprised two blocks, each involving a learning phase and a matching task, with the order counterbalanced across participants. The blocks represented self-symmetry and self-asymmetry associations, with participants learning to associate the self with symmetric or asymmetric shapes relative to a stranger. The matching task required participants to determine if a shape-label pairing was correct, with feedback provided for each response. The task design, inspired by Sui et al. (2012), included 240 trials per block, divided into matched and nonmatching shape-label pairings, and self-related or stranger-related shapes, following 24 practice trials.


### Experiment 2: 

#### Participants
One hundred and four participants (Mean age = 22.72 years, SD = 6.28 years, 14 males) voluntarily participated in exchange for course credits. All of them were naive to the purpose of the experiment and reported normal or corrected-to-normal vision. None of them had participated in Experiment 1.

#### Procedure
Before starting the experiment, participants read the informed consent form approved by the Ethics Committee for Psychological Research at the University of Padova (protocol number 3455, February 10th, 2020), and then gave their consent to participate through a response key.Everything was identical to Experiment 1, except that the type of association was manipulated between participants. Half of the participants were randomly assigned to the self-symmetry association, and the other half to the self-asymmetry association. As in Experiment 1, the keyresponse category association was counterbalanced across participants. Participants were presented with 240 experimental trials (2 matching [matched vs. nonmatching] × 2 shape [self-related vs. stranger-related] × 60 repetitions), which were preceded by 24 practice trials.
