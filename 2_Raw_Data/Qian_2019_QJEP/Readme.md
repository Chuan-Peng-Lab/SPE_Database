### Experiment 1：

#### Participants

Twenty-six participants (10 males) with ages ranging from 18 to 22 years were recruited. All were right-handed and had normal or corrected-to-normal visual acuity. Participants completed pre-screening measures for depression and anxiety disorders using the SDS and SAS scales.

#### Procedure
The experiment comprised mood induction procedures using the Velten method to induce four emotional states: happiness, anxiety, serenity, and depression. Emotional statements, translated into Chinese and assessed for valence and arousal, were accompanied by emotional music. A Latin-square design was employed to counterbalance the sequences of mood induction procedures across participants, with sessions spaced roughly one week apart. Following mood induction, participants engaged in a label-shape matching task across four sessions. Each session involved participants associating identity labels with geometric shapes and assessing whether they matched based on verbal instructions. The task was followed by mood assessment using the Self-Assessment Manikin scale, evaluating valence and arousal levels to gauge the effectiveness of mood induction procedures.

### Experiment 2: 

#### Participants
Twenty-six participants (seven males) aged 17 to 21 years were recruited. All were right-handed with normal or corrected-to-normal visual acuity. Participants underwent screening for depression and anxiety disorders using the SDS and SAS scales.

#### Procedure
Experiment 2 aimed to investigate the influence of arousal on the self-prioritization effect using a label-shape matching task. Participants were induced into a depressive mood, characterized by low arousal levels, using the same mood induction procedure as in Experiment 1. Following mood induction, arousal levels were manipulated using alerting cues, specifically auditory "beeps" presented during blank screen periods. The label-shape matching task involved associating geometric shapes with identity labels (self or celebrity), with only two shapes (triangle vs. hexagon) and two identities used to eliminate confounds of familiarity. Each trial began with a central fixation cross, followed by a blank screen with or without an alerting cue. Participants responded to label-shape pairs and received visual feedback at the end of each trial. The task was followed by arousal assessment using the Self-Assessment Manikin scale. Data analysis involved examining arousal ratings, response accuracy, and reaction times (RTs) on matching trials, with Bayesian factor analyses performed in addition to null hypothesis tests. The results indicated that alerting cues effectively raised arousal levels and strengthened the self-prioritization effect, suggesting that arousal modulates self-referential processing.

### Experiment 3: 

#### Participants
Sixteen participants were recruited, with ages ranging from 21 to 26 years and predominantly right-handed. All participants had normal or corrected-to-normal visual acuity and reported no symptoms of depression within the three months prior to testing.

#### Procedure
The mood induction procedure and label-shape matching task mirrored those in Experiment 2, with the addition of associating geometric shapes with different reward levels ("￥5" for high reward and "￥1" for low reward). Participants completed trials where label-shape pairings conformed to instructions and gained extra rewards for correct responses, varying based on the shapes present.
