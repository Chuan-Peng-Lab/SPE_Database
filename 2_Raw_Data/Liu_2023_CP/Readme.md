### Experiment 

#### Participants

The data were collected from 299 adult participants recruited via the Prolific platform in August 2021. Participants were required to reside in the UK, have near-native English proficiency, and normal or corrected-to-normal vision. The sample consisted of 44% female, 54% male, and 2% non-binary individuals, with a mean age of 32.14 years. Participants had diverse educational backgrounds, with 26.76% holding a high school degree, 55.18% holding an associate or bachelor’s degree, and 18.06% holding a degree higher than a bachelor’s. The study received approval from the Committee of Ethics, and participants provided informed consent.

#### Procedure

The experiment, conducted using the Gorilla Experiment Builder, comprised three parts. Firstly, participants underwent a learning phase to associate unknown faces with self or stranger labels. Next, a perceptual matching task was administered, where participants judged whether labels matched facial models presented in sequences. Finally, participants completed a facial emotion recognition task with emotional composite faces. The entire experiment lasted approximately 2 hours, and participants also completed self-report measures of personality and social cognition. Detailed instructions were provided before each task, and feedback was given during practice trials to ensure task understanding.
