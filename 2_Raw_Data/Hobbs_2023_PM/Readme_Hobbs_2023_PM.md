### Experiment 

#### Participants
We recruited participants aged 18 to 65, fluent in English, with normal or corrected-to-normal vision, through campus advertising at the University of Bath. As depression severity is positively skewed(Tomitaka, Kawasaki, & Furukawa, 2015), to ensure balanced levels of depression we screened participants using the Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9; Kroenke，Spitzer, & Williams, 2001). We recruited an equal number of participants with no depression (PHQ-9 < 5), mild depression (PHQ-9 5-9) and moderate to severe depression (PHQ-9 ≥10). 

#### Procedure
Participants completed two testing sessions, on average eight days apart (SD 3). At each session participants completed a social evaluation learning task, allowing measurement of test-retest reliability. To reduce fatigue effects associated with reaction time tasks, participants completed a go/no-go task at session one and an associative learning task at session two. At each session participants completed self-report measures of mood after the cognitive tasks.
