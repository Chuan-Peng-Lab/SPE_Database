### Experiment 

#### Participants
Thirty-one adolescents (mean age = 20.4 years, SD = 1.77; 17 females)participated in this study. Participants were recruited primarily from the University of Ottawa, and from the general population. The study took place at The Royal Ottawa's Institute for Mental Health Research and lasted approximately 2 hr per participant, for which they were financially compensated. The study was approved by The Royal Ottawa Research Ethics Board (REB#2017019) and all participants provided written informed consent prior to participation.

#### Procedure
Participants began by undergoing an EEG resting-state measurement, fixating on a gray screen with a white cross for 7 minutes. They then completed a modified perceptual matching task, originally developed by Sui, He, and Humphreys (2012), consisting of four blocks with learning and testing stages. Each block involved associating three geometric shapes with personal labels ("You," "friend," "stranger") and participants judged the correctness of shape-label pairs based on memorized associations. The task included four conditions with varying delays (0, 40, 120, 700 ms) between shape and label presentations, corresponding to EEG frequency bands. The sequence involved a jittered intertrial interval, followed by shape-label pair presentation, and a response window of up to 1,500 ms. Responses were categorized as "correct" or "incorrect," and the design yielded 16 conditions based on self-association, matching, and delay variables.
