### Experiment 

#### Participants
A total of 109 healthy volunteers were recruited for the study (50 males, 21.37 ± 2.50 years old, mean ± SD, the same below). They were randomly assigned into a sham rTMS group (N = 36), rTMS over LpSTS group (N = 38), and rTMS over left DLPFC group (N = 35). All participants were right-handed and had normal or corrected-tonormal visual acuity and had no mental disorders, history of epilepsy, or cardiovascular complications. This study was conducted under the Declaration of Helsinki and has been approved by the local Ethics Committee of human research at the Department of Psychology, School of Social Sciences, Tsinghua University. Informed consent was given prior to the experiment. Participants signed an informed consent form prior to the experiment and were paid ¥1 per minute for their participation.

#### Procedure
The study involved two consecutive days of experimentation. On Day 1, participants completed a self-matching task and had their motor threshold measured for TMS calibration. They were randomly assigned to one of three groups (DLPFC, LpSTS, or sham). The task had two stages: learning to associate shapes with self, friend, or stranger labels, and judging the correctness of shape-label pairings. On Day 2, participants received a 40-second continuous theta-burst TMS (cTBS) protocol over the corresponding location, with the intensity set at 80% of their individual resting motor threshold. The cTBS reduced cortical excitability for at least 20 minutes, longer than the duration of the task. TMS was delivered using a figure-of-eight coil placed tangentially to the scalp. Participants in both the real TMS group and the sham group received the same cTBS protocol and wore earplugs during TMS sessions. Sham stimulation was accompanied by similar auditory and somatosensory cues. Participants performed the self-matching task again after TMS, lasting 20 minutes.
