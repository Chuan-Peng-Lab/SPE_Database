### Experiment 

#### Participants
Forty students from the University of Trier, Germany, were included in the study (32 women, 3 left-handed, 
mean age=23.65 years, SD=3.13 years). Three additional participants were tested but eliminated from the analysis due to below-chance accuracy in the matching task (Acc<.48). The effect sizes for the SPE were large in previous studies (η2=0.67 in Sui et al., 2012). Given N=40, α=.05, a power of 1 − β=.90, and r=.30 among repeated measures, a medium-sized or larger effect of f≥.25 could be detected in this study (G*Power 3.1.3, Faul et al., 2007). All participants reported normal or corrected-to-normalvision and no participant reported any history of neurological disease. All participants gave written informed consent before the examination and received course credit or monetary compensation (15€) for participation. The study was conducted following the Declaration of Helsinki and approved by the local ethics review committee at the University Trier.

#### Procedure
The study involved a matching task with four trial types, combining two labels ("Ich" for self, "Fremder" for stranger) with two shapes (circle and triangle). Participants were shown the shape–label pairings for 60 seconds before the task began. They were then instructed to respond quickly and accurately using a response box to indicate if a presented pairing matched the earlier learned association. The task comprised 240 trials across 4 blocks, with randomized and counterbalanced order of associations and response mappings. Each trial started with a fixation cross on a computer screen, followed by a 100ms display of the shape–label pairing. Participants maintained fixation and responded within 1.5 seconds without feedback. The experimental session, conducted with E-Prime software, lasted about 15 minutes, following a practice block with feedback.
