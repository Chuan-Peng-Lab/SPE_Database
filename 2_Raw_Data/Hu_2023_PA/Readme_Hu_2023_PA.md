### Experiment 1

#### Participants
Participants in these experiments were recruited from the local community. To increase the sample size of experiments to 50 or more (Simmons, Nelson, & Simonsohn, 2013), we recruited additional participants from Wenzhou University, Wenzhou, China, in 2017 for experiments 1a, 1b, 4a, and 4b. Experiment 3b was finished at Wenzhou University in 2017 (See Table 1 for an overview of these experiments). All participants received informed consent and were compensated for their time. These experiments were approved by the ethics board in the Department of Psychology, Tsinghua University.

#### Procedure
This series of experiments employed the perceptual matching paradigm to investigate the prioritization of moral character in cognitive processes. Participants initially learned associations between geometric shapes and moral character labels, followed by a test stage to assess shape-label matching. Experiments 1a through 1c, 2, 5, and 6a confirmed the prioritization of shapes linked to "good" characters, with 1b and 1c manipulating label familiarity and indirect moral associations, respectively. Experiment 2 varied stimulus presentation to test prioritization, while Experiment 5 compared moral character with other social values. Experiment 6a, an EEG study, explored the neural mechanisms behind this prioritization. Experiments 3a, 3b, and 6b included self-reference as a variable to test the valence and self-binding accounts of the prioritization effect. Experiments 4a and 4b examined the spontaneous binding of self and good character by instructing participants to learn and respond to shape-label pairs involving self and moral character associations, with the goal of determining if the presence of "good" or "self" facilitates responses to associated shapes.
