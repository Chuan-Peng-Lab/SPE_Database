### Experiment 1  

#### Participants

The participants were 28 native Hungarian speakers aged 19 to 37 (M = 24.82, SD = 4.75, 12 male). They participated in the experiment in exchange for 1,500 Hungarian Forints (HUF) worth of supermarket vouchers. All participants had normal or corrected-to-normal vision. Based upon the critical comparison of interest (RTs toward self vs. stranger stimuli), 28 participants will provide an implied power of 96% for the large effect sizes (dz = .8) reported in previous studies.
