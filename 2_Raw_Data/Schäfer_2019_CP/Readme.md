### Experiment 1

#### Participants

The study included 103 students from the University of Trier, predominantly female (90 females), with a median age of 20 years (range: 18 to 39). All participants had normal or corrected-to-normal vision.

#### Procedure
Participants completed a series of three experiments, each involving a label-shape matching task and explicit self-esteem assessment using the RSES. Each session began with a learning phase where participants memorized label-shape associations. Subsequently, participants performed the matching task, indicating whether presented combinations matched the initial assignments. Afterward, they completed the RSES items. The experiment adhered to ethical principles, including informed consent and Declaration of Helsinki guidelines.
