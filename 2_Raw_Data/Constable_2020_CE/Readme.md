### Experiment 1: Emotional valence

#### Participants

No a priori power estimate was used to justify sample size given the exploratory nature of this initial experiment. A target of fifty-six participants was selected to double the sample size of conventional within-subject investigations of the self-prioritisation effect. This number also allowed for the appropriate ounterbalancing of response keys. See the Methods of Experiment 2 for the results of a power simulation based on the observed data of this experiment. Fifty-six adults (M = 24.36, SD = 4.25) volunteered to participate in the study in exchange for supermarket vouchers (1500 HUF). Twenty-eight were male and twenty-eight were female. All had normal or corrected to normal vision and could speak English.

#### Procedure

Participants in Experiment 1 were presented with stimuli consisting of faces displaying various emotional expressions, ranging from very happy to very sad. During the memory encoding phase, participants categorized these stimuli based on their emotional valence. After a retention interval, participants engaged in a memory retrieval phase, where they matched the encoded stimuli to labels indicating their emotional valence. The procedure included informed consent, recruitment, memory encoding, retention interval, memory retrieval, and debriefing sessions.

### Experiment 2:

#### Participants

Fifty-six adults, with an average age of 24.34 years and a standard deviation of 4.37, participated in the study. Among them, 25 were male, and 31 were female. All participants had normal or corrected-to-normal vision and were fluent in English.

#### Procedure

In Experiment 2, participants were assigned to represent themselves with either "Dark" or "Light" stimuli, which metaphorically represented negative and positive valence, respectively. After brief training to memorize the stimulus mappings, participants performed a matching task with stimuli differing in luminance. They indicated whether a given gray-scale patch matched a label by pressing designated keys. Data analysis was conducted using a mixed ANOVA to assess the effects of stimulus strength and association on response time and accuracy in match and mismatch trials. The procedure encompassed participant recruitment, stimulus assignment and training, matching task execution, data analysis, and debriefing sessions.
