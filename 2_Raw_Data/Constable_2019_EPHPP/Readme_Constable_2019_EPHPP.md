### Experiment 1  

#### Participants
The participants were 28 native Hungarian speakers aged 19 to 37 (M = 24.82, SD = 4.75, 12 male). They participated in the experiment in exchange for 1,500 Hungarian Forints (HUF) worth of supermarket vouchers. All participants had normal or corrected-to-normal vision. Based upon the critical comparison of interest (RTs toward self vs. stranger stimuli), 28 participants will provide an implied power of 96% for the large effect sizes (dz = .8) reported in previous studies.

#### Procedure
A preference-based group induction was used where participants matched with another individual who llegedly preferred the same painting. Participants then associated arbitrary shapes with "We," "They," "Me/I," and "He/She" and completed a shape-label matching task to test for we-prioritization.

### Experiment 2  
#### Participants
The participants were 28 native Hungarian-speaking participants aged 18 to 31 (M ± 22.50, SD ± 2.67, 6 male). They participated for the same reward as in Experiment 1 and all had normal or corrected-to-normal vision.

#### Procedure
The procedure was identical to Experiment 1 except for the removal of the painting induction. Participants were assigned to groups arbitrarily with portrait photographs and names, but no other information was given about the group members.

### Experiment 3  
#### Participants
The participants were 28 native Hungarian speakers aged 18 to 31 (M ± 22.68, SD ± 2.82, 8 male). They participated for the same reward and had normal or corrected-to-normal vision.

#### Procedure
The experiment was identical to previous experiments except that there was no group induction. Participants only saw the labels during the association phase, and group membership was defined by arbitrary links between shapes and the familiar meaning of personal pronouns.

### Experiment 4  
#### Participants
Twenty adult pairs aged 20 to 36 (M ± 25.43, SD ± 3.76) volunteered to participate in exchange for supermarket vouchers (1,500 HUF). Fourteen were male and 26 were female. All participants had normal or corrected-to-normal vision and could speak English.

#### Procedure
Participants were told they were in a team together and would perform the task together. The matching task was adapted for one participant to respond to Match trials and the other to Mismatch trials in a complementary go/no-go task setup. Participants were trained to associate shapes with themselves, their team, a stranger, and another team, and then completed the task in blocks with feedback after each block.
