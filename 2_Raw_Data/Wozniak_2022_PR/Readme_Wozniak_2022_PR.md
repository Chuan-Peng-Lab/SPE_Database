### Experiment 1：

#### Participants
A power analysis was conducted using G*Power 3 software (Faul et al., 2007) to estimate the required sample size for one-way repeated-measures ANOVA with three within-subject measurements (which was our target level of analysis) suggested a sample size of 12 participants (f=0.4, α=0.05, β = 0.8, assumed correlation among variables = 0.5). Expected efect size was estimated based on the weakest efect in reaction times in matching trials from Sui et al. (2012) and was the same as this efect in the no-labels task in Woźniak and Knoblich (2019). We set the target number of participants to 18 to ensure full counterbalancing of stimuli used in the experiment.Twenty-three people participated in Experiment 1. Four participants were excluded due to error rates above 40%, and one was excluded because one of the pseudo-words (“Miru”) was the name of her friend’s cat. The remaining 18 subjects had the mean age of 24.5 years (SD=3.2, range between 20 and 30). Eleven were females.All participants gave their informed consent in the written form according to the procedure approved by the Ethical Research Committee of Central European University and were paid for their participation. This applies to all reported experiments.

#### Procedure
The experiment was divided into two parts: a standard matching task (Sui et al., 2012) and a pseudo-words task. In the first part, participants learned to associate three geometrical shapes with three identities ("You," "Best Friend," "None") and then performed a matching task with 360 trials across three blocks, followed by feedback. The second part reused the shape-identity associations but introduced three pseudo-words ("Miru," "Nenu," "Varu") for the matching task, which also consisted of 360 trials with identical structure to the first part, but with shapes paired with pseudo-words instead of labels. Each learning phase in the pseudo-words task lasted 30 seconds, and participants' data were excluded if they recognized the pseudo-words.


### Experiment 2: 

#### Participants
Twenty-one people participated in the frst experiment. Two participants were excluded from the analysis due to chancelevel performance in the pseudo-words task (total error rate above 40%), and one due to program malfunction during the experiment. Among the fnal 18 participants the average age was 24.2 years (SD =3.5, age range between 18 and 34). Twelve participants were females and 6 males. All participants gave signed informed consent according to the procedure approved by a local ethics committee and were paid for participation.

#### Procedure
The procedure was identical to Experiment 1, except for one diference. In the pseudo-words task, during the learning phase the second stage of the learning phase consisted of establishing associations between pseudo-words and geometrical shapes, rather than presenting “meanings” of pseudo-words (compare with Fig. 1). In Experiment 2, participants were told that each pseudo-word made a pair with each shape. For example, they could read that: “You have 30 s to code this information: Nenu—triangle, Miru—square, Varu—circle”. However, the subsequent matching task was identical to the one in Experiment 1, so participants judged the same pairings of shapes and pseudo-words. 

### Experiment 3: 

#### Participants
Eighteen participants were recruited and tested for the third experiment. All of them were females and their mean age was 23.3 years (SD =4.8; range between 19 and 40).

#### Procedure
The procedure was identical to Experiment 1 with one exception. In the pseudo-words task, during the second stage of the learning phase participants were instructed that identities are “paired with” each pseudo-word, and not provide their meanings. For example, an instruction could state “Nenu pairs with you, Miru pairs with friend, Varu pairs with none”.
