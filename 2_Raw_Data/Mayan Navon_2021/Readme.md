### Experiment 1  ： Self, Friend, and Stranger

#### Participants

Participants in all experiments were undergraduate students aged 18 to 40, with Hebrew as their mother tongue. All were with normal or corrected-to-normal vision, and without learning disabilities or attention disorders. The study was approved by the Ethics committee of the Psychology and Education department at the Open University of Israel. Thirteen participants (3 males, Mage = 27.23, SDage = 4.87) completed Experiment 1. This sample size was matched to Sui et al.'s (2012), experiment 1. In all subsequent experiments, the sample size was doubled to obtain higher statistical power. This sample-size of 27 subjects provides a power of more than 99% to find a within-subject effect with a size of η2 = .64 (the effect size found in the central comparison of RT in match trials, see below. Calculated with G-Power; Faul et al., 2007).

#### Procedure

The experiment utilized E-prime software and a 23.5" monitor. Participants were seated approximately 60 cm from the screen. They were first asked to name their best, gender-matched friend and select a gender-matched name unfamiliar to them. Following this, they learned associations between geometric shapes and identities (self, friend, stranger). In the matching task, participants indicated whether shape-label pairings matched or mismatched the learned associations. Each trial began with a fixation cross, followed by the presentation of a shape and label. Feedback was provided after each response, and overall performance information was given at the end of each block.

### Experiment 2  ：Other Memory Hierarchy

#### Participants

The participants in Experiment 2 were 27 students aged 18 to 40, with 9 males. They were asked to recall the name of a family relative (male) who does not belong to their nuclear family and select a stranger's name from a list of common Israeli male names before the experiment began.

#### Procedure

Experiment 2 aimed to test the prioritization effect using a memory hierarchy that did not include the self-concept. Instead, concepts of father, close-relative, and stranger were used. Geometric shapes were paired with these concepts in the acquisition stage. In the matching task, participants were presented with pairings showing labels for father, close-relative, and stranger. The procedure otherwise mirrored that of Experiment 1.

### Experiment 3  ：Comparing Competing High-ranked Concepts

#### Participants

Experiment 3 involved 27 students aged 18 to 40, with 12 males. These participants were similar to those in Experiments 1 and 2.

#### Procedure

The procedure for Experiment 3 closely mirrored that of Experiment 1, with the only difference being the inclusion of the father concept alongside the self-concept and the stranger's name. Geometric shapes were paired with the Hebrew words for "you," "father," and the stranger's name. This experiment aimed to compare the prioritization effect between the self and father concepts within the same context, testing whether the presence of two highly ranked concepts would diminish the self-prioritization effect.

### Experiment 4  ：Re-Ordering the Hierarchy

#### Participants

Experiment 4 involved 27 students aged 18 to 40, with 9 males. One participant was excluded from the analysis due to low overall accuracy.

#### Procedure

The procedure for Experiment 4 was similar to Experiment 1, with the main difference lying in the acquisition phase. Participants were instructed to learn the associations in a fixed sequential order, starting with the friend-shape pairing, followed by the self-shape pairing, and ending with the stranger-shape pairing. This manipulation aimed to reduce the tendency for participants to prioritize self-related associations during the matching task. Otherwise, the experiment closely resembled Experiment 1 in all other aspects.
