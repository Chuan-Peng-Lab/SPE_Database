### Experiment 

#### Participants
The study involved 105 Chinese undergraduate and graduate heterosexual students, consisting of 51 men and 54 women, with a mean age of 21.47 years (SD = 2.19). They were randomly assigned to four groups based on social feedback and facial attractiveness conditions. The gender distribution and age did not significantly differ across the groups. All participants were single, right-handed, and had normal or corrected-to-normal visual acuity. Prior to participation, written informed consent was obtained, and the research was approved by the ethics committee.

#### Procedure
Participants were informed that the study aimed to explore first impressions and mate selection. They were asked to provide a photo of themselves a week before the experiment and were told that opposite-sex individuals would evaluate their attractiveness for potential relationships. In the formal experiment, participants rated their own attractiveness before receiving social feedback from 30 opposite-sex individuals, followed by a perceptual matching task and completion of the perceived social support scale. The social feedback paradigm involved 30 trials, with participants receiving positive or negative feedback on their desirability as a romantic partner from opposite-sex individuals of high or low facial attractiveness. Participants responded to questions about their desire to be in a relationship with the individuals and interpreted their feedback. Finally, participants were debriefed about the true purpose of the experiment before leaving.
