### Experiment 

#### Participants
A total of 380 healthy young participants were recruited to carry out a number of questionnaires and behavioral tasks while resting state and brain structure scans were conducted. After excluding those who failed to complete the perceptual matching task or lacked demographic data (n = 20), or had excessive head motion during scanning (n = 12, defined as > 0.2 mm mean framewise displacement), the final sample used for analysis consisted of 348 individuals (182 women; mean age, 22.5 years; age range, 18–34 years). All the participants provided informed consent. This study was conducted under an ethical protocol approved by the Ethics Committee of the Center for Biomedical Imaging Research at Tsinghua University.

#### Procedure
Although the self has traditionally been viewed as a higher-order mental function by most theoretical frameworks, recent research advocates a fundamental self hypothesis, viewing the self as a baseline function of the brain embedded within its spontaneous activities, which dynamically regulates cognitive processing and subsequently guides behavior. Understanding this fundamental self hypothesis can reveal where self-biased behaviors emerge and to what extent brain signals at rest can predict such biased behaviors. To test this hypothesis, we investigated the association between spontaneous neural connectivity and robust self-bias in a perceptual matching task using resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) in 348 young participants. By decoding whole-brain connectivity patterns, the support vector regression model produced the best predictions of the magnitude of self-bias in behavior, which was evaluated via a nested cross-validation procedure. The out-of-sample generalizability was further authenticated using an external dataset of older adults. T
