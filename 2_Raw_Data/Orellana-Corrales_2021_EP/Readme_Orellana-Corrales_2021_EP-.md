### Experiment 1 

#### Participants
A minimum sample size was established through a priori power calculations using G*Power (Faul et al.,2007). Prior studies have reported the SPE as a medium to large effect in size (dz > 0.81 in Sui et al., 2012, and dz ≥ 0.58 in Schäfer et al., 2016), and a study using self-face and other-face as stimuli in a dot-probe task to measure attentional capture reported a large effect size for congruency between target location and selfassociation of stimuli (η2 p ¼ :19 in Wójcik et al., 2018). On this basis, we expected the effect of selfprioritization in the dot-probe task to be medium in size(f = .25; Cohen, 1988). For a repeated-measures multivariate analysis of variance (MANOVA; see O’Brien and Kaiser, 1985, for the use of MANOVA to analyze repeated-measure designs) of mean RTs with one group, six measurements (2 [target position: self vs. stranger] × 3 [type of representation: familiar vs. new vs. pair]), α = .05, correlation among the measures = .50, a minimum sample size of N = 28 is needed to detect an effect with a power effect of 1 − β = .90. In order to allow for dropouts and exclusion of outlier responses, a total of 34 participants (25 female, Mage = 23 years, SDage = 3.5) completed the study. All participants had normal or corrected-to-normal vision and were able to complete the study in German. Before performing any data analyses, the distribution of RT and error data for the dot-probe task and matching task were individually observed in order to detect outliers. Data from six participants were excluded due to the average of their RTs and error rate falling three interquartile ranges above the third quartile of the sample distribution of all participants in either one of the tasks (Tukey, 1977). The study was carried out according to the principles of the Declaration of Helsinki, on the basis of informed consent

#### Procedure
Participants were instructed in German on a computer screen to associate geometric shapes with the labels “I” and “stranger.” No shape images were shown during this phase. They then completed a dot-probe task, starting with 24 practice trials with feedback, followed by 240 experimental trials without feedback. Each trial involved a fixation cross, self and stranger stimuli, and a target for discrimination. An exploratory detection task followed the same procedure but was not included in the analysis. Finally, a matching task was conducted to replicate findings and compare with the dot-probe task, with 128 trials after a practice phase. Participants were thanked, debriefed, and compensated or offered class credit.

### Experiment 2 

#### Participants
The minimum require sample size was established through a priori power calculations which were performed in G*Power (Faul et al., 2007). In Study 1, we observed a large effect size for the interaction between target location and type of representation (ƒ = .72) and a high correlation among measures (between r = .77 and r = .92). For a repeated-measures MANOVA with one group, 4 measurements (2 [target location: self vs. stranger] × 2 [type of representation: familiar vs.new]), α = .05, correlation among measures = .70, nonsphericity correction ε = 1, and a conservatively chosen medium effect size of ƒ = .25 for the expected interaction effect, a minimum sample size of N = 25 is needed to detect an effect with a power of 1 − β = .95. The study was completed by 34 participants (23 female; Mage = 21 years, SDage = 2.8). Before analyzing the data, each participant’s mean RT and error rate were compared with the sample distribution, separately for the dot-probe task and the matching task, in order to detect outliers in the data. The average RT of two participants were observed within three interquartile ranges above the third quartile of the sample distribution of all participants (Tukey, 1977); their data weretherefore excluded from all analyses.

#### Procedure
At the beginning of the experiment, the participants were asked to associate one nonword to the concept “I” and one nonword to the concept “stranger.” To this end, the randomly assigned nonword was presented above the word to which it should be associated (i.e., “self” or “stranger”). Each combination was presented four times for a duration of 3,000 ms, alternating between the self-associated and strangerassociated pair. In order to mimic the way in which the association instructions are often worded in the SPE literature (e.g., Schäfer et al., 2015; Sui et al., 2012), the selfassociated pair was always presented first. The experiment then proceeded with a discrimination dotprobe task as described in Study 1, followed by the SPE matching task as also described in Study 1. In both tasks, nonwords were used instead of geometric shapes.
