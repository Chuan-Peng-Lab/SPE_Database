### Experiment 

#### Participants
In a study at Ghent University, 39 adults with autism (69.2% diagnosed with autism spectrum disorder) and 31 neurotypical adults participated, with all having normal or corrected vision. Exclusions due to task performance left a behavioral sample of 36 with autism and 30 neurotypicals, showing no significant group differences in demographics or IQ. EEG analysis was conducted on 32 participants with autism and 27 neurotypicals. Autism symptomatology was assessed using the Autism Spectrum Quotient and Social Responsiveness Scale – Adult, with the autism group differing significantly from neurotypicals. Cognitive abilities were evaluated using the Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale. All participants provided informed consent, and the study was ethically approved.


#### Procedure
This study adapted a task from Sui et al. (2012), using three geometric shapes and labels to test associations with personal names. Participants, who had known their close others for an average of over a decade, were asked to match shapes with their own name, a close other's name, and a stranger's name. The task began with a practice session where participants learned shape-label pairings and responded to whether they matched within a time limit. Feedback was provided, and those with accuracy below 70% were excluded. The test session followed, with shorter display times for shape-label associations and no feedback, consisting of 360 trials in six blocks. The experiment was conducted using E-prime Studio.
