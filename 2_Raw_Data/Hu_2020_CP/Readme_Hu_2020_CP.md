### Experiment 1  

#### Participants
The sample size of this study was determined in a dynamic way(Schönbrodt, Wagenmakers, Zehetleitner, & Perugini, 2017). Specifically, we kept collecting data until strong evidence was obtained for the critical hypothesis (i.e., BF10 ≥ 10 for the interaction between Self-Relevance X Valence on RT data) or the critical null hypothesis (i.e.,BF10 ≤ 0.1 for the interaction). In total, 46 college students (27 females, age: 20.91± 2.58) were recruited. Four participants were excluded from data analysis because of procedural failures, and one additional participant was excluded from analysis of the shape-categorization task because of zero accuracy performance in one condition.

#### Procedure
The experiment flowchart outlined the procedure as follows: Participants initially engaged in a perceptual-matching task with 48 practice trials, followed by three blocks of 120 experimental trials. This was immediately followed by a shape-categorization task consisting of 6 blocks of 144 trials, interspersed with five small matching blocks of 48 trials. Each trial in the perceptual-matching task started with a central fixation cross for 500 ms, then a shape-label pairing for 100 ms, and a blank screen for 800-1100 ms, during which participants judged the match of the shape-label pair by pressing response buttons. Feedback was given for 500 ms after each response. In the shape-categorization task, each block began with a categorization cue on the screen, followed by a central fixation for 500 ms, a shape for 100 ms, and another fixation cross for 800-1100 ms, with participants responding as quickly and accurately as possible using the keyboard.
