### Experiment 1  ： Self, Friend, and Stranger

#### Participants

The sample size of this study was determined in a dynamic way
(Schönbrodt, Wagenmakers, Zehetleitner, & Perugini, 2017). Specifically, we kept collecting
data until strong evidence was obtained for the critical hypothesis (i.e., BF10 ≥ 10 for the
interaction between Self-Relevance X Valence on RT data) or the critical null hypothesis (i.e.,
BF10 ≤ 0.1 for the interaction). In total, 46 college students (27 females, age: 20.91± 2.58) were
recruited. Four participants were excluded from data analysis because of procedural failures, and
one additional participant was excluded from analysis of the shape-categorization task because of
zero accuracy performance in one condition.
