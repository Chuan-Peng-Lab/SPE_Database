### Experiment 

#### Participants
A total of 328 participants successfully completed the study posted on Amazon Mechanical Turk using the Cloud Research platform (formerly TurkPrime [58]), with an overall completion rate of 70% (30% accepted but did not complete the posting) and a bounce rate of 9% (decided not to complete the study after viewing the description). Data was collected between June 26 and July 30, 2020. Participants were paid $9 USD for completing the task, which took an average of 64  min to complete (including consent process and self-timed breaks to a maximum of 180 min total task duration). A total of 40 participants were excluded for the following reasons: uncorrected issue with vision (n=2), previous head injury which resulted in temporary unconsciousness (n=2), more than one missed manipulation check (>10%, n=4) [59], performance on the self-prioritisation task which was more than two standard deviations below mean (i.e.,<31% overall accuracy, n=9), more than 50% of self-prioritisation task trials removed or an overall mean greater than two standard deviations above the average for reaction time on the shape-label matching task (n=31). Participant demographic information for the fnal dataset from 288 participants is available in Table 2.

#### Procedure
Psychiatric traits for the fve conditions were measured using the Autism-Spectrum Quotient (AQ) [60], Borderline Personality Questionnaire (BPQ) [61], Schizotypal Personality Questionnaire (SPQ) [62], Beck Anxiety Inventory (BAI) [63] and Beck Depression Inventory (BDI) [64]. Explicit self-concept was measured by two questionnaires, the Self-Concept and Identity Measure (SCIM) [12], and the Self-Concept Clarity Scale (SCCS) [13]. Implicit self-prioritisation was measured using a label-shape matching task [3]. Te demographic information, AQ, BPQ and SPQ were completed in that order before the self-prioritisation task. Te SCCS, SCIM, BAI and BDI were completed following the task. Tis order did not change across participants.
