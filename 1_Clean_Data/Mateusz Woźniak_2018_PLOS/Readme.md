### Experiment 1

#### Participants

Nineteen people participated in the study, but one person was excluded due to the low quality of the EEG data obtained. The age range of the remaining eighteen participants was between 20 and 30 years (M = 25.4, SD = 3.03). Half of them were female and all of them were right-handed. All participants had normal or corrected-to-normal vision.

#### Procedure

The experiment 1 procedure comprised three main stages: learning, testing, and the main task. During the learning phase, participants were sequentially presented with three faces accompanied by labels ("You", "Friend", or "Stranger") to establish associations between labels and faces. The testing phase confirmed these associations before proceeding to the main task phase, where participants judged whether presented labels matched the faces by pressing keys, while their reaction times and EEG were recorded. The experiment employed strict control and random design to ensure the credibility and accuracy of the results, providing crucial insights into the cognitive processes underlying facial recognition and social cognition.

### Experiment 2

#### Participants

Twenty participants were tested. Two were excluded from the analysis because of poor quality of the EEG data (more than 40% of trials had to be excluded due to EEG noise). Out of the remaining eighteen participants 9 were females. The range of age of the participants was between 18 and 39 years (M = 25.9, SD = 5.47). Two participants were left handed, but their results did not differ from the rest of the group. All participants had normal or corrected-to-normal vision. The study has been approved by the Ethical Research Committee of Central European University. All participants gave informed consent in written form.

#### Procedure

The procedure was the same as in Experiment 1, with one exception: the order of the stimuli was reversed. The first stimulus was a label ("You", "Friend","Stranger"), and the second stimulus was a picture of a face.
