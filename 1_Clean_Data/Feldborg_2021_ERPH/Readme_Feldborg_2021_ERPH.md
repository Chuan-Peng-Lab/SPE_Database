### Experiment 1  

#### Participants
No a priori power analyses were performed to determine sample size given that this experiment was conducted as a pilot study. For clinical trials, a sample size between 25 and 50 is considered reasonable [36]. The sample size was set to 42 in each group to allow for full stimuli counterbalancing. Eighty-four undergraduate students from a British university participated in the experiment in exchange for course credits. A total of 13 participants identified as men, 70 as women, and one as a different gender, with the mean age of 21.24 years old (SD = 4.09, range from 18–51). Half the participants were randomly assigned to the shape-label matching task with “self” and “friend” labels and the other half with “self” and “stranger” labels. Participants were recruited through the online recruitment system of the psychology department. The study was approved by the School of Psychology’s Ethics Committee (protocol code PEC/4535/2020/8 and date of approval 6 October 2020).

#### Procedure
Participants completed a self-biases assessment through a shape-label matching task where vertical and horizontal ovals represented themselves, a friend, or a stranger. They judged if the shape-word pairings matched pre-learned associations, after naming the friend and stranger for concreteness. The experiment included practice blocks and four formal blocks with 320 trials, each participant completing 16 conditions. Anxiety levels were evaluated using the GAD-7 questionnaire, categorizing participants into anxiety levels from minimal to severe, with scores used in regression and ANOVA analyses. The internal reliability of GAD-7 was high, and depressive symptoms were also measured using the BDI-II for control. The task was adapted for online completion and took about 15 minutes.
