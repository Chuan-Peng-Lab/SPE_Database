## Participants

36 college students from Tsinghua University community participated the experiment were compensated. All of them are right-handed and have normal or corrected-to-normal vision. 30 of them scored on Beck Depression Inventory (BDI) below 10, 6 of them had BDI data higher than 20. In the low BDI group, which is the control group, three participants were excluded due to invalid trials, program malfunctions, or other reasons that resulted in a lack of valid data. Therefore, a total of 27 participants with low BDI scores and 6 participants with high BDI scores were included in the final analysis.

This experiment was approved by the IRB at the Department of Psychology, Tsinghua University. All participants were fully informed and agree to participate the task. All of them were compensated for their time after the experiment. 

### Notes:

Participants whose data need to be excluded: 6008, 6015, 6031

Participants with high BDI score: 6005, 6006, 6010, 6022, 6025, 6036


# Procedure	
The task in this study is modified from Sui et al (2012). Participants finished the tasks individually in dimly lighted room. Stimuli were presented and responses were collected using E-Prime 2.0 on PC. The monitor was at 1024 × 768 resolution with 100 Hz refresh rate.

Upon arriving the laboratory, participants were given written informed consent. After reading and signature on the consent, participants finished three parts of tasks: behavioral experiment 1, behavioral experiment 2, and questionnaires. Finishing the whole experiments needs approximately 80 minutes.

Experiment 1: 2 (match vs. non-match) ×3 (associations: self v. other, high reward v. low reward, happy v. sad) × 6 (sessions: 6) × 2 (participants: control vs. sub-clinical depression). Participants need to learn three associations (self vs. other, happy face vs. neutral face, and low reward vs. high reward)
	
Experiment 2: 2 (match vs. non-match) × 3 (id: self, friend, stranger) × 4 (emotion: control, neutral, happy, sad) × 6 (sessions: 6) × 2 (participants: control vs. sub-clinical depression). Participants associate three different circles to self, best friend and stranger.
