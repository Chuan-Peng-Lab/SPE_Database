## Participants

Ninety-two adult participants (46 pairs, M = 21.93, SD = 2.78) volunteered for the study in exchange for supermarket vouchers (1500HUF). Among them, seventy-three were female and nineteen were male. All participants had normal or corrected-to-normal vision and were native Hungarian speakers. Written informed consent was obtained from all participants prior to testing. The procedures were approved by the local ethics committee (United Ethical Review Committee for Research in Psychology [EPKEB]) and complied with the ethical standards outlined in the Declaration of Helsinki (1964).

## Procedure

All instructions were provided in Hungarian, with translations for English text. Before the experiment, participants were asked to input their names and select a name from a list of 20 names that did not belong to someone they knew. These names were randomly selected from the most common Hungarian first names given to babies born between 1995 and 1999.

    Shape assignment and training

Participants were assigned shapes (Triangle, Diamond, Circle, Pentagon, Star) to represent themselves or the selected name. A training session of 12 trials was conducted, where participants decided whether the stimuli represented themselves or the selected name. The pairs achieved high accuracy in this training (M = 98.01%, SD = 4.37%). Following this, participants completed a matching task, and the shapes and labels were rearranged. The rearrangement was counterbalanced between participants.

    Matching task

In the joint task, participants indicated whether a given shape and an identity label matched by pressing designated keys ('Z' or '3'). Response mappings were counterbalanced. Participants were instructed to avoid verbal communication during matching task trials. The visual angle was estimated based on an average viewing distance of 57 cm. Feedback regarding accuracy was provided after each block of trials. Factors such as location, stimulus, label, and trial type were fully counterbalanced and randomized within a block.
