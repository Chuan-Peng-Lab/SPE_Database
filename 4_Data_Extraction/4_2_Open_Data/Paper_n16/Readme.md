### Experiment 1  ： Equivalent context

#### Participants

Twenty undergraduates (14 female, Mage = 19.32, SD = 5.08) took part in the experiment. All participants had normal or corrected-to-normal visual acuity. Informed consent was obtained from participants prior to the commencement of the experiment and the protocol was reviewed and approved by the Ethics Committee at the School of Psychology, University of Aberdeen.

#### Procedure

Participants in Experiment 1 completed a matching task involving geometric shapes representing themselves and their best friend. They were required to indicate whether the shape-label pairs presented on the screen matched or not. Each trial began with a fixation cross followed by the presentation of a shape-label pairing, with participants reporting the accuracy of the association. The experiment consisted of practice trials followed by experimental trials, with the order of presentation randomized. After completing the task, participants were debriefed and dismissed.

### Experiment 2  ：Confrmatory context

#### Participants

Twenty-four undergraduates (16 female, Mage = 19.72, SD=2.33) took part in the experiment. All participants had normal or corrected-to-normal visual acuity. Informed consent was obtained from participants prior to the commencement of the experiment and the protocol was reviewed and approved by the Ethics Committee at the School of Psychology, University of Aberdeen.

#### Procedure

Participants arrived individually and were briefed about a matching task involving geometric shapes representing themselves and their best friend. The experiment utilized a 2x2x2 repeated-measures design, manipulating Stimulus Frequency, Shape Association, and Matching Condition. Participants completed two blocks of trials with varying frequencies of self and friend-related shapes, followed by debriefing upon completion.

### Experiment 3  ：Dis-confrmatory context

#### Participants

Twenty-five undergraduates, including 18 females and 7 males, with an average age of 20.4 years (SD = 2.75), participated in the experiment. All participants had normal or corrected-to-normal visual acuity and provided informed consent. The study protocol was approved by the Ethics Committee at the School of Psychology, University of Aberdeen.

#### Procedure

Participants underwent a matching task involving geometric shapes representing themselves and their best friend. The experiment employed a 2x2x2x2 repeated-measures design, manipulating Stimulus Frequency, Shape Association, Matching Condition, and Trial Number. The task closely followed Experiment 2 but with a different manipulation of stimulus-related frequencies, wherein participants were misled about the frequency of self and friend-shaped stimuli. Each participant completed two blocks of trials, with the order of experimental blocks counterbalanced. Upon task completion, participants received debriefing and were thanked for their participation.
